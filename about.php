    <p><b><?= $farmName ?></b> was founded in 2010 with a plot of land, some pocket change, and a bit of know how. Our mission is to produce great tasting, healthy produce with minimal impact on the environment.  All of our produce is grown sustainably at Larison’s Turkey Farm, a historic landmark in Chester, New Jersey as well as a satellite location in beautiful Pohatcong Township.  By using minimum tillage, bio-intensive practices and never using GMO seed each year our soil becomes richer.</p>
    <p>In addition to growing a multitude of produce, we raise chickens, and have our own line of specialty items made using our own produce. Our “Farm-to-Jar” products consist of jellies, jams, raw honey, marinara sauce, hot sauce, and salsas.</p>
    <p>In 2018 founder Josh Chaffee partnered with fellow farmer Morgan Hess. Both students of Elliot Coleman’s New Organic Grower and Jean Martin-Fortier’s Market Gardener, their partnership is based upon a mutual passion for growing gourmet quality produce for the Morris County area.</p>
