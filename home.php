			Hello Everyone! We are very exited to announce that this week we plowed the field. We will be planting all of our blueberries, strawberries, and asparagus. Also all of the spring seedlings will be going into the ground! We expect to have the first harvest of spring veggies at the end of may(spinach, lettuce mix, snap peas, etc…) Our bees look great and we expect to get some of their delicious honey this season! Check back for more updates and photos
